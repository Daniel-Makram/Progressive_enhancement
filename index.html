        <p id="Bold_p">Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or
            that
            gaz
            opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
            there’s no
            such
            thing as an issue.</p>

        

            <p class="Flex_Mars--txt">Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think
                it.
                Nothing
                exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
                reality
                changes.
                That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we
                mis
                translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
                on
                that way.
                Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
            </p>

            <p class="Flex_Mars--txt">They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
                out
                of that
                grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
                person is
                the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make
                your
                world,
                it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            <br><q>The Old Chinese Farmer</q>
        </div>

        <p class="Flex_Story--P1">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of
            his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said
            <br><q class="Villager">"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate."</q>
            The farmer said,
            <br> <q class="Farmer"> "Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't
                know."</q>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back
            and said,
            <br> <q class="Villager">"Isn’t that lucky. What a great
                turn of events. You now have eight horses!"</q> The farmer again said,
            <br> <q class="Farmer"> "Is it
                <span class="good">good</span>?
                Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know."</q>
        </p>

        <p class="Flex_Story--P2">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he
            was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said,
            <br><q class="Villager">"Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad"</span>,</q> and
            the
            farmer responded,
            <br><q class="Farmer">"Is it
                <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't
                know."</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they
            rejected
            his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <br><q class="Villager">"Isn’t that great!"</q> Again, he
            said,
            <br><q class="Farmer"> "Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I
            don't know."</q>
        </p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
            because
            you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
            class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...
